# Kubernetes knowledge repository
#MOC 

Contained in this directory is a knowledge repository for useful information about Kubernetes (AKA, k8s) that we have accumulated and do not wish to lose.  Since a great deal of our exploration into k8s culminates in knowledge rather than code artifacts, this repository will be how we maintain and communicate the results of our exploration.

This repository comprises a set of Markdown-formatted notes, but browsing of this repository is meant to be done via [[Obsidian]].  One notable consequence of this decision is that links will use the Wikilinks standard, rather than the Markdown standard, as they are more naturally supported in Obsidian.  This will likely have some negative effects for casual viewing via GitHub or your local IDE.  This focus on Obsidian is experimental, and if it proves controversial, we may abandon it.

The remainder of this README is a [map of content](<8-Documentation conventions/Maps of Content.md>), which should provide useful entry points into other parts of the note repository.  You may also prefer to use the [graph view](<8-Documentation conventions/Obsidian#Graph view>) to navigate this repository.
