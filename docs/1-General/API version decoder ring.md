# API version decoder ring
Created: 2022-07-05, 18:32

Resources defined by YAML manifests need to have an API version specified.  The `apiVersion` that should be used varies by the `kind` of resource.  The [[#^version-guide|guide]] linked below suggests which API version to use for each resource type.

> **Note:** the linked guide is already 4 years out of date!  We should aim to find a more current resource, or prod the author to update this page.
