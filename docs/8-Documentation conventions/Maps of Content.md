# Maps of Content
Created: 2022-06-29, 17:54

To organize groups of related notes, create a Map of Content (MOC).  These should be preferred over the use of a more rigid directory structure.  Please use the `#MOC` hashtag in these notes to allow navigation from the tag pane.

MOCs do not need to form a comprehensive index.  They exist to help organize and contextualize groups of notes, but it is not necessary to use MOCs to create a full note hierarchy.  This is also a tool for shaping the [[Obsidian#Graph view|graph view]].
