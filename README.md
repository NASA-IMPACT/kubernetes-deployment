# Kubernetes Deployment Resources

The intention of this repository is to collect the resources needed to deploy a Kubernetes cluster to various different providers through various different IaC providers.  For the moment, that only encompasses using Terraform to deploy to AWS, but we hope to offer better coverage in the future.

We are also attempting to use this repository as a knowledge repository for lessons learned as we acquire more experience with this technology.  See the [documentation](docs/README.md) for more.

If your interest is to just deploy a cluster, take a look at the deployment [instructions](deployment/aws-terraform/README.md).
